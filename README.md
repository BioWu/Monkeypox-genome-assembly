# Monkeypox-genome-assembly
Genome assembly pipelines for next- and thrid-generation sequencing datasets

## 1. Next-generation sequencing
We used the GATK Mutect2 to call SNVs. 

## 2. Oxford/nanopore
We modified the [ARTIC](https://github.com/artic-network/fieldbioinformatics) pipeline to generate the genome of MPXV.
